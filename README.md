# q4twitterClone
An assessment that was completed during the 4th quarter of the year I spent at Kenzie

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate ability to establish many to many relationships with a model, filter queries to show only posts made by other users in a user following list, and to send notifications. 

In order to view this functionality, you can go to the display users and follow some of the mock profiles to view their mock tweets. To view notification functionality, please create 2 users, send a tweet with one user with an "@username" somewhere with in the tweet, then log into the other user you created. 

Please follow the following steps to start the project:

Clone this repo onto your machine

CD into the project

In your terminal, enter the commands:

Run "poetry install"

Run "poetry shell"

Run "python manage.py generate"

Run "python manage.py runserver"

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/

Create two user accounts, create tweet w "@" plus one of the usernames, log into username to view notification, follow other users to add their tweets to your feed.

Thank you
